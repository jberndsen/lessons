Starter for Angular 2 without Gulp and TypeScript compiler
==============================================

A minimal setup for creating and running Angular 2 apps using TypeScript.

## Installation

* Install gulp globally by running `npm install -g gulp`
* Install local project dependencies by running `npm install`

## Running the project

* Simply call `gulp` to build the project and start a local web server running it. When you make a code change, it automatically re-transpiles and reloads.

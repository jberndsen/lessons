Angular 2 lesson pack - lesson 4
==============================================

## Installation

* Install gulp globally by running `npm install -g gulp`
* Install local project dependencies by running `npm install`

## Running the project

* Simply call `gulp` to build the project and start a local web server running it. When you make a code change, it automatically re-transpiles and reloads.

## Lesson content

This lesson code shows how to create services and inject them using constructor injection.
We use ngModel and ngSubmit for data-binding and adding them to our newly created service.
Finally, the entered data is shown using ngFor to repeat elements, see the `notTodoList` component.

Starter for Angular 2 without any dependencies
==============================================

Open the `src`-folder of this project in a local webserver. I use "httpster" which you can install with `npm install httpster -g`.

The TypeScript transpilation occurs in the browser, so the TypeScript compiler is not needed. If you use WebStorm and it prompts to compile the files for you, just say "no".
